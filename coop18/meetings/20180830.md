# Origin and destination dettections

- Paper to be submitted to BigData (seattle in december)
- Decision tree on google drive

# Visual Analytics Workflow

ra data -> tableu cleaingin -> cleaned data -> ml -> model

eric

1. import data sources
    - from files, database, etc
    - cominge data sources with joins
    - define data types in tableau
    - create data heirarchies
2. create the visualiztion
    - createing a graph or chart
    - use "show me" graph sugestions
    - change attributoes, i..e color
    - aggreagreasion, sum, average, etc.
    - geographic maps
3. analyze the data
    - view subset of data used in chart
    - create a trend line
    - create a forecaset from data data atnd at lease one measuer
    - create clustring (kmaeans)
4. data cleaning
    - remove outliers/values
    - correct values that need corrections

Google refine
Can create dashboard - all graphs together in one view

matt
ML part

- create custome application
- create a guide

SCUII Learn

- create model

# Offline OCR
brendon and brenan

1. state of art wu2016 process

kmeans - split colors in picturee
- text all one color
- pull out text

kmeans cow image "Detection GUI"

- then use edge detection on where text is

then write it and send off to ocr

- rust boats

- examine all clusters for text

Big picture - plan

Crop text block with paint - output "ocean boy" image block of text

Brendan - kmeans clustering to get text bounding box


# ML Algoritm Metrics

# Next meeting
- idea: personality test generator - what ml algorithm are you
