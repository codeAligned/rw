# Data Visualization

## Tools

Plotly - makes html using d3


## Overall process

### Tools + Visualization UI

Open Refine http://openrefine.org

import csv
choose columnnames
chose featues
choose graph
show grape

color /size

### Future work

 - more graphs, cutomization options
 - connect with matt's machine learning ui
 - multiple grapsh outtp at th esame time
 - regression lines and trend lines

### questions

 Flask server - 

 raw -> clean -> cleandata -> machine learning -> final model

 ### Tableau Tutorial Dox

- imports
- create viz
- analyze vis
- links at end

## Machine Learning User Interface MLUI

- clean data
- define data
- data manipulate
- algorime param
- model
- measure

### Options

- simple model
- advance model
- load modle
- visualization
- help

### 

- clean data
- define data
    + type of learning
    + data type
    + feature select
    + algrothim?
- data manipulate
- algorime param
- model
- measure

model creation and reults - show results

- export - pickle model, results as csv, weights as csv

### Videos

load data
choose predict
make model
test model

### future

- custome alg support
- support more class of alg
- more types of data
- recommend alg

### questions

- model is a pickled output
- spark job, run on yarn, map reduce?


## OCR Project

- Where it is at

### Partial approaches

- Wu 2016 Detection Alg
    + long to implement
- Canny Edge Detect
    + partial sultion
- Matlab Text Detection
    + attempt to get C++ working
    + could not get to work on own machines
    + port to python using tesseract
- Wu2016 process
    + color clusters
    + multi scale color
    + process
        o color cluster
        o edge detect
        o text detect
        o text realigh
        o character detect
- MSER - Matlab implementation
    + eccentricity - adjust
    + combine

- MSER alternative to
