### max swing

vary inputs to extremes   
see change on output  
plot swing  

### rule generation

can vary inputs by less to experimenet and learn how you model value

Two Layers:

1.a. convolution layer
1.b. pooling layer
2. fully connected layer

real world example

facial recognition

key ideas:

- windowing - break image in to various parts
- put back to togther

check out yassine ghouzam

numbers between 0 and 9

Kearas hides some complexity of using tensor flow

heat map pictures of image data

relu is activation function

make more training data

zoom in / out 
rotate

training loss / validation loss used to determine overfit or not

## use probabilites of results

things not sure about may need to be checked by a human

machine will tell you how sure it is

## could do ensemble method

as is numbers
fat numbers
skinny numbers

# Next week

SMOTE
ROC
AUC

# Cnn

can you combine additional info
i.e. number
how many full loops
how many right angles

not sure??
