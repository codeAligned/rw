## Homework

sensitivity analysis from last semester:

V26, V30


## Random Forest

Bagging of random decision trees

Random rows
Random colums

Build model

2000 models vote
what do they mostly all say?

R sample


random forest can help find most important features

accuracy and gini index

rpart builds a regular decisiion tree

count testingData:
what is false + and false -?

are v30 and v26 most important

what if just use v26 v30 v4?
same errors

pick a new dataset

will SVM work on same 3 varibles?
only get two errors, 1 false neg, 1 false pos

what about using just v30 and v26?
works ok
...

a->j 10/10/10

v30 is concave points "worst"
v26 is warea "largest"

30 variables, only 3 matters


## conclusion

- dataset not as rich
- random forest pointed out 2 most important features
