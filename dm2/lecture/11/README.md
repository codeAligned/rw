## Link Analysis

Examples: Links Between

- 9/11 Hijacker Links CopLink Informatics
- Car Accident Fraud
- Dr. Fraud Prescriptsion

### Neo4j - graph database

#### 6 degrees from kevin bacon

multiple joins to get result

graph database get there faster

### R 

install.packages("igraph")

directed graph

### Link analysis

edge density - overall # connected edges / # possible connections

size of bubbles

arrows coming to / arrows leaving

an **authority** has lots of links to it

a **hub page** has lots of links from it


### Link Prediction

A friends CDEF friends B  then AB will probably become friends

co-citation coupling - or papers AB similar

how oraganized crime may evolve

### Page Rank

yahoo + ask jeves human based

altavista (pre google) subject to term spam - 

term spam: bunch of terms on screen with same background color

### Google

**Page Rank** - would users browse to page starting from random places?

uses link analysis

page rank handles to spam farm (surrounded by other pages that link)

probabilities 

M ABCD
A
B
C
D

eigenvectors - mult matrix by eigenvector get same matrix back

special eignevector - all values add up to one

therefore get eigenvectors

get eigenvalues

R has page rank

do it on 20 node example

shows 4 as having highest page rank

citation analysis - which papers were important

citation - originally came from law
then applied to papers
then applied to patents

gives important patents
