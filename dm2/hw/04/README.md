See Slide 7 in PPT 4b - More Bagging etc.
Note no need for a challenge question.  The rubric is given in the slide.

Homework: Build a better classifier than the default one discussed here.
Modifying hidden nodes will not vastly improve it and cause it to correctly predict 3, 4, 8, 9.

You should not need boosting

I have some ideas but use your own as well

Manipulate the training data to reduce the number of 5,6,7 and increase the number of 3,4,8,9.  You can actually add duplicate records to train a classifier

Do the model in multiple stages.  Predict Good wines and bad wines, then among the good try to predict 6,7,8,9 and among the bad try to predict 3, 4, 5

Somehow combine a tree or forest with an SVM or NN to either do method A or something else

Think up another bright idea

I don’t know if any of these will work.  (I could never give this problem to an undergraduate class, because there is no linear path from problem to solution.  You may try things that don’t work; that’s research)

Best 5 solutions get a 10.  All reasonable attempts delivered on time get at least a 9.  Try something novel and get a 10 even if it doesn’t perform very well

You may work with someone else. (Your submission should include code, an output and a word document explaining your method)
