# 1. Hand back midterms.  Any questions on midterm?  Go over last question.

## Dendogram question.

## Last question.
classfiy new data same way
dtermineg gopod bad credit

# 2. Mini-Talks

## Will Foran: Multi-processing

can speed up scripts

GIL - global interpreter lock

example: multithreaded web crawler

single thread maxes out at 6 scripts per processor

pool.map(x,y)


## Ron: Knowing all of Data Science?

# 3. Main topic: Na√Øve Bayes

numerators only

not "mathematically pure" becuase all must be independent

example: play golf

know probablities from train data

use it to  predict new cases

Laplace Smoothing
addative smoothing (add 1 to numerator and denominator)

Handles missing values well
just left out of counts

R

library('e10171')

nb var naem will show all intermetidaee

example: spam detector with naive bayes

spammers got smarter:
- white text on white background
- mispellings vi@grf@
- weblinks instead of text in email

now we need naieve bayes + other things to detect smape

word by word nieave bayes predict each word?

levinschtein edit distance?

better yet - let user mark it as spam

sentiment analysis?

look at tweets that mention

"sucks" vs "great"

look at all words of tweet

predict postive, negative, or neutral 

emoticons can help id which words have positive connotation vs. negative

i.e :( or :)

will happen in text mining

naieve bayes vs. previous model to predict 50k on census data

# 4. Mini-talk: Wordclouds

good openers

tweets during dem event

trump cloud on philadelphia enquirer

can fix word clouds (i.e. add stop words 'say' or 's')

checkout wordcloudAB.py

andreas christian mueller git hub for wordcloud

uses his stop words

can leave out retweens with 'a'

can add stopwords

can show bar graphs over time

---

tweets - public domain - tweets are twitters property

twitter keeps 9 days of tweets for people that post a lot

180 days or more for people who rarely tweet

can buy old tweets from harvesters

ex/ full text of new york times
