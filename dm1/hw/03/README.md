# R Markdown Homework

1. Google R markdown which is a nice add-on to R useful for making tutorials and presentations in R.
1. Create an R markdown notebook in R with 3 simple features. A banner up top with your name etc. and what the notebook is going to do.
1. Create a heading announcing something simple like adding 2+2 then put in the computation.
1. Create another heading announcing a plot and embed a simple plot into your notebook.
1. Create another heading announcing a Latex feature and then create a formula using embedded Latex. You can google latex and r markdown if you know nothing about Latex in order to get an idea.
1. Turn in the notebook and the knitted or compiled HTML markdown notebook for 9 out of 10 points.  To get the 10th point create another heading announcing the extra feature and then do something else that uses r markdown but is not covered above. Doesn't have to be complicated or hard, just something a little extra that you find in your research that you didn't use for the first 9 points.

## Notes
