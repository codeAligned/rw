# Here is assignment 1.  

## Part A. Choose Only 1 of the following

1.Create an API Key for Google+ and get one of my programs working on your system to dump a bunch of 
web sites for some search term
2.Write something to do the same for Bing or an alternative search site

## Part B. Also Choose Only 1 of the following

1.Download the twitter API keys and use one of my programs to download all of the tweets related to a 
keyword, hashtag, or screen name.
2.Use the API to do something completely different like:
a)Given a screen name, list all of its followers
b)Find the trending topics
c)Given a tweet, find all the times it has been retweeted
d)Anything else, as long as it uses the API

## Deliverables: Output of google search program (topic of your choice).  Output of several tweets from 
twitter handle of your choice or search topic or equivalent. Source code if you modified my code.
Note:  Doing the above is worth 9 out of 10 points.  To get the 10th, do something extra like write your 
own program or do something with the twitter API that my code doesn't do, or convert my Python 2.7 to 
3.6 etc.  Don't go crazy and spend 10 hours on anything, but learn something!
