# Assignment 4 - Mixed Data Distances 

1. Compute 5 similarity/distance matrices for table in slide 10 of Lecture 4a (You can use R, Python, Mathematica, Excel, a calculator, Whatever)
2. Convert all to Similarity Matrices
3. Add 5 together (don't forget to give twice the weight for the nominal and asymmetric binary matrices) and divide each entry by 7 to get a single 6x6 similarity matrix with entries between 0 and 1
4. Note if you don’t get a symmetric matrix with 1’s on the diagonal then you did something wrong!
5. Ask and answer a challenge question of your choosing for the 10th point.
It shouldn't take long.  We'll make it due Monday because it's useful to master this before the midterm. Sorry.
