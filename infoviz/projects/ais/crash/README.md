## Allision vs Collision

Allision[edit]
In maritime law, it is occasionally desirable to distinguish between the situation of a vessel striking a moving object, and that of it striking a stationary object. The word "allision" is then used to mean the striking of a stationary object, while "collision" is used to mean the striking of a moving object.[1][2][3] So when two vessels run against each other, it is called collision whereas when one vessel ran against another, it is considered allision.[4] The fixed object could also include a bridge or dock. While there is no huge difference between the two terminologies and often they are even used interchangeably, it is important to determine the difference because it helps clarify the circumstances of emergencies and adapt accordingly.[5] In the case of Vane Line Bunkering, Inc. v. Natalie D M/V, it was established that there was the presumption that the moving vessel is at fault, stating that "presumption derives from the common-sense observation that moving vessels do not usually collide with stationary objects unless the [moving] vessel is mishandled in some way.”[6] This is also referred to as The Oregon Rule.

Accident Location: Tarrytown , NY   Hudson River  
Accident Date: 3/12/2016  
Accident ID: DCA16FM033  

Date Adopted: 5/11/2017  
NTSB Number: MAB-17-14  
NTIS Number

### Executive Summary
About 0500 on Saturday, March 12, 2016, the uninspected towing vessel Specialist, transiting southbound on the Hudson River while towing a tower crane barge with two other tugboats, struck a construction barge that was spudded down alongside a concrete pier at the new Tappan Zee Bridge construction site.1 The Specialist subsequently sank, resulting in three crew fatalities. The Specialist was raised to the surface on March 24, 2016, and declared a constructive total loss. 

### Probable Cause
The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the collision and sinking of the Specialist was inadequate manning, resulting in fatigued crewmembers navigating three tugboats with obstructed visibility due to the size of the crane on the barge they were towing and the location of the tugboats alongside the barge

Accident Location: Vieques Island , PR   Virgin Passage, 9 miles east-northeast of Vieques Island  
Accident Date: 9/23/2014  
Accident ID: DCA14PM019  

Date Adopted: 7/11/2016  
NTSB Number: MAB-16-09  
NTIS Number:

### Executive Summary

On September 23, 2014, about 0635, the 110-foot-long US Coast Guard cutter Key Largo collided with the 42-foot-long fishing vessel Sea Shepherd in the Virgin Passage, about 9 miles east-northeast of Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. Just before the collision, the two Sea Shepherd crewmembers, who were hauling lobster traps on board, jumped in the water. No one was injured. The Key Largo sustained minor damage; the Sea Shepherd sank about 2 hours after the collision.

### Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the collision between the Coast Guard cutter Key Largo and the fishing vessel Sea Shepherd was the failure of the cutter’s officer of the deck to detect and avoid the Sea Shepherd, most likely because he had fallen asleep prior to the accident. Contributing to the collision was the officer of the deck’s failure to report to the commanding officer his unfitness for duty due to lack of sleep.

Date Adopted: 4/23/2013 
NTSB Number: MAB-13-04 
NTIS Number:   

### Executive Summary

The containership Maersk Wisconsin, assisted by two tugs, left Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, in the early morning hours of December 5, 2011, to begin its transit south toward Kill Van Kull, through New York Harbor, and then to sea for its destination in the United Arab Emirates. At 0213, with fog reducing visibility to about 0.25miles, the containership collided with a tug and barge unit in Kill Van Kull channel near Bergen Point, New Jersey.

### Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the docking pilot on board the Maersk Wisconsin to position his vessel according to the meeting arrangement with the Ruth M. Reinauer, and to allow adequate separation for passage of the tug and barge in the navigable channe

Accident Location: Philadelphia , PA  
Accident Date: 7/7/2010  
Accident ID: DCA10MM025  

Date Adopted: 6/21/2011  
NTSB Number: MAR-11-02  
NTIS Number: PB2011-916402  

### Executive Summary

On Wednesday, July 7, 2010, the empty 250-foot-long sludge barge The Resource, being towed alongside the 78.9-foot-long tugboat Caribbean Sea, collided with the anchored 33-foot-long amphibious passenger vehicle DUKW 34 in the Delaware River at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. DUKW 34 carried 35 passengers and 2 crewmembers. On board the Caribbean Sea were five crewmembers. As a result of the collision, DUKW 34 sank in about 55 feet of water. Two passengers were fatally injured, and 26 passengers suffered minor injuries. No one on the Caribbean Sea was injured. Damage to DUKW 34 totaled $130,470. Damage to the barge was minimal; no repairs were made. 

### Probable Cause

The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the mate of the Caribbean Sea to maintain a proper lookout due to (1) his decision to operate the vessel from the lower wheelhouse, which was contrary to expectations and to prudent seamanship, and (2) distraction and inattentiveness as a result of his repeated personal use of his cell phone and company laptop computer while he was solely responsible for navigating the vessel. Contributing to the accident was the failure of Ride The Ducks International maintenance personnel to ensure that DUKW 34‘s surge tank pressure cap was securely in place before allowing the vehicle to return to passenger service on the morning of the accident, and the failure of the DUKW 34 master to take actions appropriate to the risk of anchoring his vessel in an active navigation channel.

Accident Location: Point Judith , RI   Block Island Sound  
Accident Date: 7/2/2008  
Accident ID: DCA08FM023  

Date Adopted: 12/3/2010  
NTSB Number: MAR-11-01  
NTIS Number: PB2011-916401 

### Executive Summary

​On Wednesday, July 2, 2008, about 1215 eastern daylight time, the 187-foot-long passenger and car ferry M/V Block Island collided with the 140-foot-long U.S. Coast Guard cutter Morro Bay in reduced visibility on Block Island Sound, about 4 nautical miles south of Point Judith, Rhode Island. The ferry, carrying 294 passengers, eight crewmembers, two concession stand employees, and one off-duty employee, had departed Point Judith about 25 minutes earlier and was traveling south, headed for Old Harbor on the eastern side of Block Island, Rhode Island. The cutter, carrying 21 personnel, had departed Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, about 1015 and was traveling west, headed for Coast Guard Station New London, Connecticut. As the vessels approached the accident site, the visibility decreased due to fog. At the time of the collision, the crew on the Morro Bay estimated the visibility at about 500 yards.
As a result of the accident, the Block Island ferry sustained about $45,000 in damage and the Morro Bay about $15,000. Two ferry passengers were treated for minor injuries and released that same day.

### Probable Cause

​The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of the collision between the ferry Block Island and the Coast Guard cutter Morro Bay was the failure of the bridge watch officers on both vessels to monitor their radars, sufficiently assess traffic, and compensate for limited visibility. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the bridge watch officers on both vessels to maintain a proper lookout and to sound appropriate fog signals.

## 2008.01 Allision of Liberia-Registered Fruit Juice Carrier M/V Orange Sun with U.S.-Registered Dredge New York

Accident Location:   , NJ   Newark Bay  
Accident Date: 1/24/2008  
Accident ID: DCA08FM009  

Date Adopted: 12/2/2009  
NTSB Number: MAR-09-03  
NTIS Number: PB2009-916403

### Executive Summary

​On January 24, 2008, about 1352, the 672-foot-long, Liberia-registered fruit juice carrier M/V Orange Sun allided with a dredge, New York, while the juice carrier was outbound under pilotage in Newark Bay. About 25 minutes into the transit, the pilot ordered a 5° starboard course change from 200° to 205° and then reduced the speed to dead slow ahead as the juice carrier approached the dredge. The helmsman on board the Orange Sun experienced difficulty trying to steady the ship on the ordered course, and after a brief series of increasing port wheel inputs to arrest the vessel’s swing to starboard, he put the wheel to midship, or zero angle. Both the helmsman and the master then made several wheel inputs to try to correct the vessel’s heading, including at least three incorrect wheel inputs to starboard, which the pilot had not ordered and which were made without his knowledge. The actions of the helmsman and the master caused the ship to steer toward the dredge, with insufficient time to avoid the allision.
As a result of the allision, the New York sustained about $6 million in damage, including salvage costs, and the Orange Sun about $330,000. About 100 gallons of mixed oil from the dredge’s machinery was released as a result of the accident. No one was injured.

### Probable Cause

​The probable cause of the allision of the Orange Sun with the dredge New York was the master’s failure to appropriately use bridge resource management and to communicate; specifically, to familiarize his bridge crew with and inform the pilot of the vessel’s occasional tendency to sheer, a characteristic that he had personally experienced. Contributing to the accident were the inappropriate starboard rudder movements made by both the helmsman and the master, which interfered with the pilot’s ability to take appropriate action to prevent the allision. Also contributing was the second officer’s failure to accomplish his primary duty as officer of the watch, which was to properly monitor the helmsman.
