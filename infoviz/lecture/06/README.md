## Visual Analytics: Definition, Process, and Challenges Paper Summary

Robert Reeders, Edward Carter, Nicholas Mariani

- Challenges
    + sources for data are increasing

Information Overload -> Opportunity

# VA


Data -> Visualization and Models -> Knowledge

# Areas Used

Machine learning  + Humand Ognitation

- demographic graphs
- data management
- data analysis
- perceptiona nd cognitionat
- human-computer interation
- infrastruture and evaluation

# Scalablity

# Quality of data

- Analysits can misinterpert data
    + Uncertainty
    + Limitations
    + Errors in input data
    + Chosen algorithsm used
- User should be aware of uncertainties

# Visual Representations

- Selecting finde details to provide a global overview can prove difficult
- Patternes and relationships need to be visualized on many levels of detail
- appropropriate level of data

# User Interfaces

- UI must be easy to use
    + user should be foceuse ont tasks

# Display Devies

- must adapt to avialable display options
    + Large scale walls to small portable devieces
    + what can audinces see
    + what ...

# Evaluation

- No eval framework exists
    + visual analytics has a complex and hetrogeneous probblemdomain
    + ...

# Infrfastructure
    + Smooth interations needed (memory, dis, graphics card, algoritme efficiency

# Applications

VA can process vast amounts of data: i.e.  cell phone GPS.

Show graph

Paper: geo map

Temporal histogram: distribution of stops

map showing flow with different size arrows on map

# Example: international flight data

too much data

limit to u.s. and asia

# VA

computation + human intuition

=> interactive visualization

validate visual analytics via user case study

########## Data Wrangling

Tom, Jeff, ..

# What is data wrangling

 - raw data -> analytings
 - data munginsg

# Research Directions in Data Wrangline

- visualization could speed up cleaning data

# Existing issues

- data relevance
- data format
- time invstment to change formatns
- missing data
- inconsitente
- duplicate data
- transformation
- cleaning

~ 80% tima dn cost

- discourages people from engaging some datasets

## Issues Summary

- More time spent wrangling data than studying it
- Imposes a needless learning curve
- removing cleaning curve allows more people to analyze

# visualization proe

algorithmic
- duplicat removal
- schema matching
    + compare tables for relations
- eitity resoulutoin
    - disambiguation


# Visualization cons

- dirty data can be difficutl to visualize

connection maps

data aggregations

heatmap of bins

# Data at scale

- use hexgonal 2d bins
    + improves density estimates
- use good color schemes
- sampling
    + confidence interval
    + no need for complete dataset

# Automation

- Algorithms
    + find discrepencies and outliers
- Validation Routines
    + RegEx patterns
- Complex Data Mining
- Active Learning
    + data dirty or missing?

# Visualizing missing data

- 0
- blank
- fade
- interpolate

5 types uncertaitny

- measurments precision
- completenetess
- inference
- disagreement
- credibitliy

# Glyphs

# Transforming Data

various tools

# Correcting Erroneous Values

- batch process
- fill in
- interpolate


# Mergings

schema matching imports

# Editing and Auditing Transformation

Need scripts to keep up with needed transformations

# Modification and Reuse

Code your data cleaning to be resued
