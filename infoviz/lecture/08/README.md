## Visualization

- Data -> Insights
- Computation + Human Intuition
- Data Mining + HCI

## Building Blocks

- Collection
- Cleaning
- Integration
- Analysis
- Visualization
- Presentation
- Dissemination

## Automated Data Processing

## Classification

- Predictct which of a (small) set of classes to which an enttiy belongs

## Regression

- numeric value estimation

## Similarity Matching

- find similar entities in a large dataset based on what we know about them

## Clustering

group entitites by the similarity

## Data Reduction

Dimensionality reduction - shring a large dataset into a smaller one with as little loss of data as possible

1. visualize in 2d/3d
2. faster computation / less storage
3. reduce noise

compress as litte as possbile so you don't loose data

## Data Visualization - design an interactive graph to best present data insights

## Scatter Plots / Bubble Charts

time vs. location

size - numeric values
shape - category
color - category / numeric
transparancy - intensity

## Map Chart

Where

## Heatmap

## Multi Axes Charts

- multiple y axis
- sharing same x axis
- see relationships

## alendar View


- month over years
- year of months
- heatmap (by color)

good for time series data

## Treemap

size and heirarchy of data

## Nested Circles

size and heirarchy

## Project Prototype

- is bermuda triangle real?
    + does data support
    + data is all the same
- why are there spikes in the transponder data?
- heat map of trouble
- area near north carolina - lots of ship crashes
- area odd failures
