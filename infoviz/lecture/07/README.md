# Lecture 07 - Data Integration and Management

What is data integration?  Combine data from multiple sources to provide the user with a unified view.

Why is it important?  Think about apps, websites, and services you you use every day.

Businesses **derive value** through data integration.

## Examples:

- Google Maps
- Social media - data from users, businesses
    + Facebook: your posts, advertizements, review
- Search engine: Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.
- Smart assistants: Siri, Cortana, Alexa
- Prices comparison: Kayak
- Uber, Lyft: drivers, traffic data, customers
- Google maps: restaurants, users, traffic
- Amazon.com
