# Lecture 01 2019.01.24

## Previous experience.

- Arm surgury simulation.
- 3d chest organ project
- crowd simulation for military
- microvasculature image augmentation and extraction
- eye tracking

Publications

- Immersive data analytics
- Flight track data
- Wildlife preserve data

Tableau visual analysis via Tableau

- Flight track data
- Wildlife preserve data

use tableau to explore and clean data before using data

Final project goal

design visualization to tell story to stakeholders about data

typical workflow

get data
look at data with tableau
clean data
design data processing strategy
visualize cleaned data

How can we view all data on 1 graph?  Use 3d virtual reality to create immersive graph.

**GOAL**

Data -> Insights

How?

Computation + Human Intuition

## Human intution - knowing without thinking

|Data Mining |Human Computer Interaction (HCI) |
|---|---|
|Automatic |User-driven; iterative|
|Summarization,<br>clustering, classification | interaction, visualization |
|millions of items| thousands of items|

# Mission and Vision

scalable, interactive, usable tools for big data analytics

# What is Visual Analytics?

Polo's definition:  the interdisplinary science of combining computation techniques and interactive visualiation...

# Ingredients

storage
complex system design
scalablity fo alg
visualization techniques

# World of data

data ever increasing

# So what?

- make money, google, facebook, etc
- websearch
    + rank
    + predict next to type
- advertisments
    + infer intrest
- medical ...

# Course goals

- visual and computation techniques
- complement each one
- work on real data & problem
- learn practical know-how
- gain breadth of knowledge

# Goals
