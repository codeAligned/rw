Q1: Characterize the senors's performance and operation.  Are they all working property at all times?  Can you detect any unexpected behaviors of the sensors through analyzing the readings captured?

characterize sensors performance and operations

how often does the sensor capture data

# Load tableau

Load Mc2 sensor data

look at how many records expected 24x9x(30+31+31) = 19872 readings per chemmical
does data have that many records?

why would records be more or less than that

tree graph - see extra or dropped out data

heatmap

# Use tableau

Ask a question.

Generate graph to answer question.

# Example

Layered graph:

- bar graph to show ammount of release
- grey dots + missing wind
- wind direction - angular height of grey dot

# chemical relase pattern

bar graph 

# q2: chemical release pattern

hours
vs
week

with tree graph

talk about chemical release patterns

blue during day

green in morning / early evening

angular directions and vectors

4 factories x 9 sensore = 36 lines

cosine distance with wind direction vectors


ok to bin data (if data has higher frequency use smaller bins)
