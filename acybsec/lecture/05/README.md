## Talk about paper

Vulnerability scanners

### D Paper 26 pages
Malware bytes... 

cut and past vs. original content

not happy - cut and paste picture from web not alot of text

what did they do with tool

### A- Paper 38 pages

social engineering

project summary

### rubric

31-60 pages

## Metis portable

scan your own workstation - what vunerablities live on your workstation?

## OSI model

## Risk, Vulnerability, Threat, Impact

### Threats potential danger

### Threat Vector

### Malicious Insider Threat

Salami - Banker - stealing 0.01 over 20 years

goes on vacation - seeing 0.01 cent anomolies

$1 on gas station

- see hackers 2600

Address High priority vulenerabitlies

showden default configurations

Risk Management

- sometimes management will just pay

residual risk - remaining after risk management (i.e. lose power)

i.e. bug fix breaks something else

risk transference (breach insurance)

ALE on exam

Pen test - fix now

## Kill Chain (not in book)

how to hack

never plug a usb into your system
code and apps on usb to phone home

pivot

break into vulnerable system
scan hash to find 500 (admin)
crack that hash

Security controls to protect against

- attack
- breach
- lawsuit

Nist types

- technical
- management
- operational

Controls

- deterrent: cameras, dogs, signs

- preventive controls

- detective - checksum

- compensating - when other controls have failed, i.e. lose power

technical controls - firewall

administrative controls - policies, procedures

## vunerability management

5 steps

1. define wantes state
2. create baselines
3. priortize vunerablities
4. mitigate vunerabiltiies
5. monitors

scan mitigate fix

penetration testing
perform hacking to see vunerabilties
simulate attack, i.e. tools nesses/tenable, saint

vunerabilty assement

- audit and show polices (with puppet)

written policy vs. configured policy

hackers will sometimes reverse engineer code to find weakneses

results of vunerability scan

- open ports
- weak password
- default accounts and passwords
- sensitive data

i.e. web inspect - cross site scripting, sql injection

tailgating

social engineering - i.e. maintenance person dress to fix bathroom

credential vs. no credentialed scans


written authorization letter

mainframes are sensitive and have certain requirements, must be included in letter

stealth + social media

social media makes your data public
people will pull your dat

SEM tool

Security Event Management
logs / second

example Darktrace platform, splunk

password crack

stop with disclosure of data and pii
