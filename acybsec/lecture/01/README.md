## Ethics (ISC2)

### Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure.

- Promote and preserve public trust and confidence in information and systems.
- Promote the understanding and acceptance of prudent information security measures.
- Preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public infrastructure.
- Discourage unsafe practice.

### Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
- Tell the truth; make all stakeholders aware of your actions on a timely basis.
- Observe all contracts and agreements, express or implied.
- Treat all members fairly. In resolving conflicts, consider public safety and duties to principals, individuals, and the profession in that order.
- Give prudent advice; avoid raising unnecessary alarm or giving unwarranted comfort. Take care to be truthful, objective, cautious, and within your
competence.
- When resolving differing laws in different jurisdictions, give preference to the laws of the jurisdiction in which you render your service.

### Provide diligent and competent service to principals.

- Preserve the value of their systems, applications, and information.
- Respect their trust and the privileges that they grant you.
- Avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof.
- Render only those services for which you are fully competent and qualified.

### Advance and protect the profession.

- Sponsor for professional advancement those best qualified. All other things equal, prefer those who are certified and who adhere to these canons. Avoid
professional association with those whose practices or reputation might diminish the profession.
- Take care not to injure the reputation of other professionals through malice or indifference.
- Maintain your competence; keep your skills and knowledge current. Give generously of your time and knowledge in training others.

## What is information security

- protection of dadta while keeping data accessbile to users
- question? do you think we take information security serious

- do we take infomration security serious

- www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches
records breached: 11,020,563,536
some companies are required to disclose breaches
many other industries do not report breaches

how many breaches are dislosed

typically 12-18 months before companies even discover a breach
typically find out from logs
SEM - security event management systms

typically 1-2 people analyzing logs for breaches
logs get generated so fast and so much

how to analyze - deceipher 

breaches every day

don't know
don't care

average cost $236 for credit monitor for a year

ex/ large company would rather pay fine than add security
if it costs too much to fix an issue - companies will not do it

NIST - recommends password change
- guidelines - ex/ configure router




honeypot attack? 

don't count on companies to protect your data

password policy?

a lot of time ceo, cfo's don't have time for that

- dashlane, lastpass store all of your passwords
lastpass hashes password


**********************************************
Confidentiality

Integrity Accessibility

***********************************************

Confidentiality - prevent the disclousre of information to unauthorized persons
    + ensures dtat is only viewable by authorized users
        * such as personally identifiable information (PII)
    + some methods
        * encryption
Integrity - The reliablity of data - Authorization is necessary before data can be modified
    + only authorized users shoudl omdify data
        - hashing
Availablity - Data is obtainable regardless of how information is stored, accessed, or protected.
    - remove single point of failure (SPOF)
